# HTML To PDF CI

## Why I created this tool

In the process of creating my new static site, I noticed I was regenerating my resume PDF whenever I updated the source HTML.
Since the PDF is derivative of the HTML, I didn't want to maintain two sources of truth.
My friend, [Dylan](https://dylansheffer.com), suggested that I create a CI module to generate this PDF on build.
We both have web based resumes and figured this was something that could be useful to others as well.
It seemed like a straightforward task, so I started planning and designing what this tool would do.

If you just want to see the source code, you can view it on [our weekend project's GitHub!](https://github.com/our-weekend-project/html-to-pdf-ci)
Our weekend project is an organization that some friends and I created for projects that we can all easily contribute to.

## Requirements of the module

### Which argument parser to use?

I've used [Commander.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) in the past to create Node CLI applications, and so I started with this.
However, it doesn't have an easy prompt interface from what I could tell.
I wanted to have an experience similar to [release-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/release-it) and AWS' SAM CLI.
Because of this, I pivoted my CLI over to using [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) because of its easy to use prompts and the fact that release-it uses it.

Setting up an easy to use CLI using inquirer was a breeze!
After viewing the documentation on how to create questions, I created my list of question prompts and told inquirer to use them.
For example:

```js
const inquirer = require('inquirer');
let question = {
    type: 'input',
    name: 'mainInput',
    message: 'Please enter anything',
};

inquirer.prompt(question).then(answer => {
    console.log(`You entered ${answer.mainInput}!`);
});
```
When you run the previous snippet will give you this output.

```bash
node index.js
? Please enter anything <someOtherThing>
You entered someOtherThing!
```

### How to turn the interactive CLI into a CI CLI

So I have a CLI parser/prompter that I'm happy with, but I need some other parts to make the CI part of this work.
I'll need some flag I can pass to my CLI so that it skips interactive mode.
But then I'll also need some kind of configuration file so the automated CLI knows what to pass to my main `html-to-pdf` logic.
Adding a `CI` flag is straightforward enough, I added a check for `process.argv[2]` and if it's equal to `--ci` then call the main logic with the configuration file.
As for the configuration file, I went with using a JSON file that stores the prompt responses.

### How to convert HTML content to PDFs

I knew beforehand that browsers can generate PDFs from HTML content, so I figured Chrome might expose that functionality on the command line.
Turns out that this is the case, that [one can generate PDFs using headless Chrome.](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome#create_a_pdf)
However, to use headless Chrome, my users would already have to have Chrome installed on their machines.
While this is a relatively safe bet, I want my dependencies contained in my module.
So instead of headless Chrome, I picked [puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) instead.
Since using these browsers/tools to generate PDFs is a common use case, the puppeteer package has some example code on how to achieve my use case:

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
 
(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://news.ycombinator.com', {waitUntil: 'networkidle2'});
  await page.pdf({path: 'hn.pdf', format: 'A4'});
 
  await browser.close();
})();
```

All right, so I have my current requirements and a good place to start implementing.
Even if I miss some requirements, it's not a big deal.
All I have to do is iterate and improve if I discover missing features or requirements.

## The application's logic

I want the application to take in some parameters, generate a PDF and place the PDF in a location based on the previous parameters.
Again, thanks to the puppeteer snippet, generating a PDF will be straightforward (or so I thought).
In order to place the PDF in a directory somewhere, we will use Node's `fs` module.

### Puppeteer

> Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer runs headless by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

In order to called the generated PDF a success, it has to pass some test.
In this instance, I have my reference resume PDF that I will compare against.

### Generating the PDF

So we'll go ahead and modify the snippet to create our PDF and we should be done!
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

// If you haven't seen this pattern before, this is an
// immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE
(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Instead of going to hackernews,
  // we want to open our source HTML document
  await page.goto('file://D:/Repos/static-site/_site/resume/web-resume/index.html', {waitUntil: 'networkidle2'});
  await page.pdf({path: 'hn.pdf', format: 'Letter'});
 
  await browser.close();
})();

```
Unfortunately, that didn't work.
When I tried this, I was met with
```
TimeoutError: Navigation timeout of 30000 ms exceeded
```
which is not what I was expecting.
So it appears that puppeteer doesn't like trying to open local files using the file protocol...no big deal.

Instead of trying to access the file through a file protocol, we'll spin up an express server and host the file instead.

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const express = require('express');

(async () => {
    // Spin up express
    const app = express();

    // Since we want to host static content, we use
    // express' built in `static` middleware
    app.use(express.static('_site'));
    const server = app.listen(5001, async () => {

        // Our previous snippet
        const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
        const page = await browser.newPage();

        // We now navigate to localhost
        // instead of using the file protocol
        await page.goto('http://localhost:5001/resume/web-resume/index.html', { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' });
        await page.pdf({ path: 'hn.pdf', format: 'Letter' });
    
        await browser.close();
        server.close(() => {
            console.log(`Closing server`);
        })
    });
})();
```

Using this snippet, we are able to generate the following PDF
> ![First generated resume](../../../../img/htmlToPdfCI/first-generated-resume.png)

which is better than no generated PDF, but is missing some details.
First, there are no margins which makes this document look terrible!
Second, we lost the circles on our contact information.
Third, we lost the header background.
Let's go ahead and fix this.

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const express = require('express');

(async () => {
    const app = express();
    app.use(express.static('_site'));
    const server = app.listen(5001, async () => {
        const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
        const page = await browser.newPage();
        await page.goto('http://localhost:5001/resume/web-resume/index.html', { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' });
        await page.pdf({ 
            path: 'hn.pdf',
            format: 'Letter',

            // printBackground will display our background heading
            printBackground: true,

            // Chrome's print to PDF uses these margins
            margin: {
                top: '0.4 in',
                left: '0.4 in',
                right: '0.39 in',
                bottom: '0.39 in'
            } 
        });
    
        await browser.close();
        server.close(() => {
            console.log(`Closing server`);
        })
    });
})();
```
We go ahead and run this snippet and...
> ![Final generated resume](../../../../img/htmlToPdfCI/final-generated-resume.png)

ðŸŽ‰ sweet!
We now have the main logic figured out, we just need to extract magic strings and variables so that passed parameters create the variables we need!

### Inquirer

This part is where `inquirer` will come in handy.
By handling all the input and creating a compiled options object, we can pass the options to our main logic.
Additionally, if we call our CLI with the `--ci` flag then our interface will run the PDF generation automatically.

So I create the options object by asking the following prompts:
* Enter a file name for generated PDF
* Enter a destination path for generated PDF
* Enter the file name of the source HTML document
* Enter the path of the source HTML document
* Enter the path to the generated site folder
* Save responses to .htmltopdf.json?

Inquirer has different prompt formats you can use such as: `input`, `password`, `list`, `checkbox`, `confirm`, and others.
For my file name prompts, I used the simple text `input` prompt.
Since entering file paths can be tedious, I wanted prompt format that could speed up this process.
Luckily, inquirer has some featured plugins and one of these plugins is a [fuzzy path search!](https://github.com/adelsz/inquirer-fuzzy-path)
