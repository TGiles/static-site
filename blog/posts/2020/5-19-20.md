Eleventy seems straightforward.
I'm hitting hiccups but with my own thoughts, nothing to do with eleventy.
Some of the issues I'm hitting deal with templating.

I tried to split my home page into partials but I can't figure out an easy way to accomplish this.
The reason why I wanted partials is for better internal link navigation on my home page.
However I was able to use the `markdown-it-attrs` plugin.
This plugin allows me to put IDs in markdown so that my internal links have divs to anchor to.
