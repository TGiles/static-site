# 11ty Web Site

This is the new home for my personal website.
Using 11ty, I've converted my old website and added a blog section to it!
Huge thanks to [Jon Keeping](https://github.com/JonUK) and his blog post on [creating a blog with Eleventy!](https://keepinguptodate.com/pages/2019/06/creating-blog-with-eleventy/)

## But your old site worked fine, what gives?

I enjoy learning new tech and discovering if I like the new way of doing things.
Other than little content fixes, I haven't updated my personal site in years!
I suppose it felt like time to do an overhaul and pick up some more skills in the process.
I also wanted to add a blog so that I can spend more time writing my thoughts/notes in a way that can be beneficial to other people.

## Fair enough, but why 11ty? Why not <insert other static site generator>?

I definitely wanted to write my new site as a static site, regardless of which technology used.
I've heard nothing but good things about [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), but it seemed overkill for my needs.
I've had some experience with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) through GitHub Pages, so I wanted to try something different.
However [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) claims to be a "simpler static site generator".
Since my main goal was to overhaul my old site and add a blog to it, this "simpler" way of doing that was appealing to me.
So far 11ty has lived up to that claim, in my opinion!
